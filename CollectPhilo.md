## Executive Summary

This document outlines our current social media post collection strategies implemented in the Authentic Dashboard project, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, and proposing improvements for future adaptations. Our goal is to maintain reliable data collection while adapting to the evolving social media landscape and increasing privacy constraints.

## Current Architecture Overview

### Collection Infrastructure

Our post collection system consists of:

1. **Chrome Extension Components**:
   - **Content Scripts**: Platform-specific scripts injected into social media pages
   - **Background Script**: Handles message passing and API communication
   - **API Client**: Manages connections to our Django backend

2. **Backend Components**:
   - **Django API Endpoints**: Receive and process collected posts
   - **ML Processing Pipeline**: Analyzes post content for sentiment and categories
   - **Deduplication System**: Prevents duplicate posts using content hashing

3. **Data Flow**:
   ```
   Content Script → Background Script → Django API → ML Processing → Dashboard Display
   ```

### Current Collection Strategies by Platform

#### Facebook Collection Strategy

```javascript
// DOM traversal approach to find post content
const postElements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-pagelet^="FeedUnit"]');
// Extract user, content, engagement metrics, etc.
const contentElement = el.querySelector('[data-ad-comet-preview="message"]');
```

- **Strengths**: Effectively identifies post containers and extracts content, user information, engagement metrics
- **Weaknesses**: Relies on Facebook's DOM structure which changes frequently

#### Instagram Collection Strategy

```javascript
// Find post containers
const articleElements = document.querySelectorAll('article');
// Extract content and metadata
const contentElement = article.querySelector('h1 + div, div._a9zr > div');
```

- **Strengths**: Handles image posts well, extracts hashtags and mentions
- **Weaknesses**: Instagram's frequent UI updates require constant maintenance

#### LinkedIn Collection Strategy

```javascript
// LinkedIn post containers
const postElements = document.querySelectorAll('.feed-shared-update-v2');
// Extract connection information
if (connectionText.includes('1st')) {
  connectionDegree = 1;
  isFriend = true;
}
```

- **Strengths**: Good detection of connection relationships, professional content categorization
- **Weaknesses**: Professional content often contains specialized terminology requiring custom processing

## Technical Challenges and Current Solutions

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Restrictions

**Challenge**: Social media platforms implement strict CSP rules that block direct API calls from content scripts.

**Current Solution**: Message passing architecture that routes all API calls through the background script:

```javascript
// Content script sends message to background script
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  action: 'sendPosts',
  platform: 'facebook',
  posts: posts,
  apiKey: apiKey,
  apiEndpoint: apiEndpoint
});

// Background script handles API communication
function sendPostsWithDirectFetch(posts, platform, apiKey, apiEndpoint, sendResponse) {
  // API call implementation with retry logic
}
```

### DOM Structure Changes

**Challenge**: Social media platforms frequently update their UI, breaking our selectors.

**Current Solution**: Multiple selector fallbacks and robust error handling:

```javascript
// Try different content container selectors
const contentContainer = 
  el.querySelector('[data-ad-comet-preview="message"]') || 
  el.querySelector('[data-ad-preview="message"]') ||
  el.querySelector('[dir="auto"]');
```

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

**Challenge**: Platforms may rate-limit frequent collection attempts.

**Current Solution**: Throttling and cooldown mechanisms:

```javascript
const COLLECTION_COOLDOWN = 5000; // 5 seconds minimum between collections
const RATE_LIMIT_BACKOFF = 60000; // 1 minute backoff if rate limited
```

### Duplication Detection

**Challenge**: Same content appearing multiple times in feeds.

**Current Solution**: Content fingerprinting and hash-based deduplication:

```javascript
// Generate fingerprint for content deduplication
function generateFingerprint(platform, user, content) {
  const contentSnippet = (content || "").substring(0, 50).trim();
  return `${platform}:${user}:${contentSnippet}`;
}
```

## Improvement Opportunities
