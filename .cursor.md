# Authentic Dashboard: Cursor Instructions for a Fully Realized System

## Purpose
This system is a browser extension + Django backend project that filters out manipulative, irrelevant, or toxic content from Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. It aims to restore sanity, authenticity, and control to the user.

## Ultimate Goal
Build a **modular, resilient, self-updating platform** that can:
- Adapt to changing DOM structures
- Maintain long-term usability even as platforms evolve
- Perform client-side and server-side post analysis
- Give users control over filters, feeds, and visibility modes

---

## Key Components to Maintain & Improve

### 1. Content Script Architecture
- Must be modular per platform (Facebook, IG, LinkedIn)
- Use selector maps, not hardcoded values
- Implement MutationObserver and IntersectionObserver
- Use auto-healing logic (e.g., try/catch with retry strategies)
- Inject on scroll, on click, and when SPA pages update

### 2.  Post Analysis (AI + NLP)
- Use DeepFace for emotion/context scoring
- Use YOLOv5 to scan post images for manipulative elements
- Extract keywords, hashtags, and spam indicators
- All analysis done in `ml_processor` Django app

### 3. API Layer
- Expose REST endpoints for:
  - `/analyze-post/` ‚Äì sentiment, emotion, manipulation
  - `/filter-settings/` ‚Äì per-user filter rules
  - `/submit-post/` ‚Äì post data ingestion
- Secure endpoints with token/session auth
- Use Celery for async processing if needed

### 4. Chrome Extension Behavior
- Collect post data using MutationObserver
- Capture text, image URLs, author, time
- Send to backend via fetch or messaging
- Highlight, dim, or hide posts based on server analysis
- Provide toggle modes for "Friends Only", "Interest Only", etc.

### 5. Resilience Patterns
- DOM changes? Cursor should update selectors in `/selectors.js`
- Facebook broke the script? Try fallback selector paths, log errors to `/logs/`
- Unexpected post formats? Run analysis in sandboxed try/catch zones

### 6. Developer Tooling
- Set up Postman or Insomnia for API testing
- Add test fixtures for ML endpoints
- Log all errors to `/logs/errors.log` on the server
- Cursor should suggest test cases when new views are added

## Cursor Guidance

You are my dev assistant. When I say:
- ‚ÄúUpdate post scraping logic for FB‚Äù ‚Üí update `content_fb.js` using selector map and observer logic
- ‚ÄúImprove analysis endpoint‚Äù ‚Üí update `ml_processor/views.py` and serializers
- ‚ÄúAdd a fallback selector path‚Äù ‚Üí update the platform‚Äôs selector file with redundancy
- ‚ÄúRun backend analysis‚Äù ‚Üí write Django view + Celery task to run ML model and return structured results

Always suggest:
- Modular code
- Platform-specific subfolders
- Error handling and fallback logic
- Storage structure that allows filtering by platform, date, and spam score

# üß≠ Cursor IDE Assistant Guide: Authentic Social Dashboard

## üéØ Project Purpose:
This is a full-stack project that creates a **social media dashboard** to filter out manipulative, spammy, or irrelevant content from **LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram**. It aims to create a more **authentic internet experience**.

## üß± Stack Overview:
- **Frontend**: Chrome Extension (content scripts + background)
- **Backend**: Django API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ML/NLP**: Sentiment analysis, keyword categorization
- **Browser Tools**: MutationObserver, IntersectionObserver, DOM parsing

## üîç What I Need Help With:
1. **DOM Scraping Improvements**
   - Help modularize content script logic for different platforms.
   - Make selectors configurable and adaptable (platform selector map).
   - Use MutationObserver and IntersectionObserver to track dynamic content loads.

2. **Post Structuring**
   - Collect: author, content, timestamp, platform
   - Hash content to avoid duplicates
   - Add keywords, sentiment, metadata inline or via API

3. **API Integration**
   - Send collected post data from the extension to the Django API.
   - Use fetch or `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` for communication.

4. **Django Side**
   - Define robust Post and Platform models
   - Filter posts via keyword search or flags (e.g., spam score, sentiment)
   - Secure API access via token/session

5. **Future Upgrades**
   - Schedule Playwright scraping runs for backup post collection
   - Add user filters to dashboard (e.g. ‚ÄúFriends Only‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlock Buzzwords‚Äù)

## üí° Tips for Cursor:
- Prefer concise modular JS functions
- Suggest auto-extractors for common DOM post structures
- Provide clean Django model and serializer scaffolds
- Recommend ways to debounce and optimize large DOM parsing
- Flag fragile selectors or brittle scraping logic

## ü§ñ ML Integration (DeepFace + YOLOv5)

- DeepFace and YOLOv5 are Python-based models.
- They should be implemented in the Django backend inside a new app called `ml_processor` or `vision`.

**DeepFace:**
- Used to analyze facial expressions in post images.
- Exposed via a Django REST endpoint: `/analyze-face/`
- Accepts an image URL or uploaded image.
- Returns: `{ emotion: "happy", confidence: 0.91 }`

**YOLOv5:**
- Detects objects/logos in post images.
- Also exposed via `/detect-objects/`
- Returns: `{ objects: ["person", "apple logo", "car"] }`

**Frontend:**
- The Chrome extension captures image URLs from social media posts.
- Sends them to the backend for analysis using `fetch()`.

Please create the ML integration inside `ml_processor/views.py`, and add serializer + model stubs as needed.
## ‚úÖ Completed Architecture Overview (as of 2025-04-16)

- The Django backend is extensively implemented.
- Post-related logic is handled inside the `brandsensor` app (not a separate `posts` app).
- ML processing via DeepFace and YOLOv5 is **fully implemented** inside the `ml_processor` app.
- API endpoints for:
  - `/submit-post/`
  - `/filter-settings/`
  - `/analyze-face/`
  - `/detect-objects/`
  are all live and secured using API key authentication.
