Ultimate Directive
I think the ultimate directive that should guide development could be:
> "Restore user sovereignty over the digital experience by creating transparent tools that prioritize genuine human satisfaction rather than engagement metrics."
This directive emphasizes:
User control ("sovereignty")
Transparency in how content is filtered
Human-centered design (satisfaction vs engagement)
Ethical technology principles
